# Important Details

1. Each service would be cloned into this repo if you wanted to use a similar idea for the scripts in the `package.json`
2. Every server is on a different port i.e 3000, 3001, etc. 
3. The reason we're able to make a request for the bundle of each service i.e `http://localhost:3001/bundle.js` is because we're using express.static
